<h1> Description </h1>
<p> Since its inception the internet has become a huge repository of information, ranging from useful data to irrelevant social media posts. <b> It's like having the world's largest library in the palm of your hand. </b>

This rep demonstrates the potential of Web Scraping by enabling the collection of sports statistics that are ready to be analysed and used to feed technologies such as Machine Learning models and Neural Networks. </p>

<h1> Web Scraping From 0 </h1>
<p> This first Python file created was designed to extract information, which would be ready to be used and analysed. 
  
<b> Just run the code and let the magic happen. </b> </p>

<h1> Web Scraping From 1 </h1>
<p> <b> This second Python script complements the first, </b> allowing for incremental data extraction.
Since sports data are updated round by round, the script detects the latest date in the dataset already obtained and collects only the most recent records.
  
This way, the update process becomes continuous, simple, and without dups. </p>
